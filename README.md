Introduction to DesOptPy
========================

DesOptPy (DESign OPTimization in PYthon) was designed a Python-based tool for structural design optimization.  This package integrates optimization algorithms from pyOpt and pyGMO, with expansion to others being possible.  This allows for complex handling of large-scale optimization problems typical of structural design optimization.  The goal of this project was to design a versatile and general optimization toolbox for structural design optimization in which an optimization model can be set up easily, quickly, efficiently and effectively, allowing colleagues and students to dive into optimization problems without difficulty.  It is also meant to be modular and easily expanded.  Though developed for design optimization of mechanical structures, DesOptPy has been written to be flexible and, therefore, optimization problems of other disciplines can be applied.  The backend code, though, is far from perfect and not aesthetic (some of it is just plain ugly!), being written by a mechanical engineer and not by programmers.

Download
=================

DesOptPy can be downloaded an branched at the following GitHub repository:

http://github.com/e-dub/DesOptPy


Installation
=============

The quick and easy installation is accomplished via the following code:

    pip install DesOptPy


Examples
========

To learn the ways of DesOptPy a number of exemplary test problems for optimization are provided.  

Further contribution to examples from users is welcome, see the repository: http://github.com/e-dub/DesOptPyModels.
